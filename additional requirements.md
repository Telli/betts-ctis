New Set of Requirements for the Tax Information System 
New Set of Requirements for the Tax Information System 

1. Payment Methods Integration
Functional Requirements:
	Multiple Payment Gateways: Integrate local and international payment solutions (e.g., Cash, cheque and bank transfers).
	Client Payment Initiation: Clients should be able to initiate payments securely through their dashboard.

2. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
These KPIs are helpful for both internal monitoring and demonstrating value to clients. There should be different KPI dashboards for internal staff and clients:
Internal KPIs (The Betts Firm View):
	Client Compliance Rate (e.g., 87% of clients filed before deadline)
	Tax Filing Timeliness (Average days before deadline filings are submitted)
	Payment Completion Rate (Payments completed vs initiated)
	Document Submission Compliance (How many clients submitted all required documents on time)
	Client Engagement Rate (System logins, chat queries, document uploads)

Client KPIs (Client View):
	My Filing Timeliness (e.g., “Your average filing is 3 days before deadline”)
	On-Time Payments (% of tax payments made on time)
	Document Readiness Score (% of tax period documentation submitted)
	Compliance Score (A cumulative score or traffic light system based on deadlines met)

3. Reports That Should Be Generated
Reports should be available in PDF and Excel formats, downloadable from both the client and internal dashboards.
Client Reports:
	Monthly, quarterly and annual Tax Filing Report (Summary of all tax filings, dates, statuses, tax types)
	Payment History Report (Detailed breakdown of all payments made, including tax type and dates)
	Compliance Report (Missed deadlines, delayed filings, pending obligations)
	Document Submission Report (What’s been submitted, pending, rejected)
	Tax Calendar Summary (Upcoming and past obligations with status)

Internal Reports (The Betts Firm Staff):

	Revenue Collected/Processed (By tax type, client, date range)
	Client Activity Logs (Login frequency, messages, submissions, payments)
	Case Management Report (All client issues, resolutions, and timelines)

4. Compliance Tab and Metrics
This is core to CTIS and should offer both visual indicators and drill-down data.
Compliance Tab (Client View):
	Status Summary (e.g., Filed | Pending | Overdue | Not Applicable)
	Filing Checklist (Status of each required return per tax type — GST, PAYE, Income Tax)
	Upcoming Deadlines
	Penalty Warnings (Highlight overdue items with estimated penalties if applicable)
	Document Tracker
	Compliance Metrics (Displayed as Visual Tiles or Graphs):
	Compliance Score (Dynamic: green, yellow, red)
	Filing Timeliness (On-time %)
	Payment Timeliness (Payment success %)
	Supporting Documents Status (Completed %, Pending %, Rejected %)
	Deadline Adherence History (Month-by-month breakdown)
