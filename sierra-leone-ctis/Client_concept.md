Concept Note: Development of a Client Tax Information System for The Betts Firm
Background
The Betts Firm has emerged as a trusted advisor and service provider for tax,
accounting, and consulting needs across various sectors in Sierra Leone. As the firm’s
client base expands, there is a growing demand for a centralised, secure, and client-
accessible information system that can support tax compliance, recordkeeping, and
transactional transparency.
Considering this, the development of a Client Tax Information System (CTIS) is
proposed. This platform will serve as a digital platform for managing clients’ tax records,
payment histories, tax filings, and compliance statuses, while enabling The Betts Firm to
process and track payments made on behalf of clients.
Purpose of the System
The primary purpose of the CTIS is to:
 Digitally centralise all client tax-related data and documents.
 Enable clients to view, download, and verify their tax records.
 Maintain an auditable trail of payments and documentation submitted.
 Facilitate secure payments to tax authorities and third parties on behalf of clients.
 Enhance trust, transparency, and service efficiency between The Betts Firm and its
clients.
Objectives
The specific objectives of the system are to:
 Provide secure client access to tax returns, payment receipts, and filing history.
 Track document submission from clients to The Betts Firm (e.g., income
documents, supporting forms).
 Enable The Betts Firm to manage and verify that all documentation has been
received for tax processing.
 Display real-time compliance status (e.g., pending, filed, paid, non-compliant).
 Integrate a secure payment module to allow The Betts Firm to make payments on
behalf of clients with proper audit trails.

 Ensure easy retrieval and export of historical data and reports for clients and
internal staff.
Scope of the System
The system will be built with the following components:
Phase 1:
 Core Information System - Client login dashboard
 Client tax summary (tax years, filing dates, payment status)
 Document repository (returns, receipts, notices, and uploaded documents)
 Compliance tracker (showing real-time status and outstanding issues)
 Activity timeline (logs of actions, submissions, filings, and communications)
Phase 2:
 Client-Tax Firm Interaction
 Client document submission portal
 Notifications &amp; alerts (via email/SMS and dashboard)
 Query and support messaging tool (within the dashboard)
Phase 3: Payment System Integration
 Client payment request approvals (where required)
 Audit trail of all transactions (who paid, when, for what)
 Payment confirmation receipts are stored and linked to tax filings
Conclusion
The proposed Client Tax Information System will improve operational efficiency and
enhance client satisfaction, transparency, and compliance. As The Betts Firm continues
to serve a growing clientele, this digital infrastructure will be instrumental in maintaining
service excellence and scalability.

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
These KPIs are helpful for both internal monitoring and demonstrating value to clients. There
should be different KPI dashboards for internal staff and clients:
Internal KPIs (The Betts Firm View):
 Client Compliance Rate (e.g., 87% of clients filed before deadline)
 Tax Filing Timeliness (Average days before deadline filings are submitted)
 Payment Completion Rate (Payments completed vs initiated)
 Document Submission Compliance (How many clients submitted all required documents
on time)
 Client Engagement Rate (System logins, chat queries, document uploads)

Client KPIs (Client View):
 My Filing Timeliness (e.g., “Your average filing is 3 days before deadline”)
 On-Time Payments (% of tax payments made on time)
 Document Readiness Score (% of tax period documentation submitted)
 Compliance Score (A cumulative score or traffic light system based on deadlines met)

3. Reports That Should Be Generated
Reports should be available in PDF and Excel formats, downloadable from both the client
and internal dashboards.
Client Reports:
 Monthly, quarterly and annual Tax Filing Report (Summary of all tax filings, dates,
statuses, tax types)
 Payment History Report (Detailed breakdown of all payments made, including tax type
and dates)
 Compliance Report (Missed deadlines, delayed filings, pending obligations)
 Document Submission Report (What’s been submitted, pending, rejected)
 Tax Calendar Summary (Upcoming and past obligations with status)

Internal Reports (The Betts Firm Staff):
 Client Compliance Overview (All clients and their statuses for any time)
 Revenue Collected/Processed (By tax type, client, date range)
 Client Activity Logs (Login frequency, messages, submissions, payments)
 Case Management Report (All client issues, resolutions, and timelines)

4. Compliance Tab and Metrics
This is core to CTIS and should offer both visual indicators and drill-down data.
Compliance Tab (Client View):
 Status Summary (e.g., Filed | Pending | Overdue | Not Applicable)
 Filing Checklist (Status of each required return per tax type — GST, PAYE, Income Tax)
 Upcoming Deadlines
 Penalty Warnings (Highlight overdue items with estimated penalties if applicable)
 Document Tracker
 Compliance Metrics (Displayed as Visual Tiles or Graphs):
 Compliance Score (Dynamic: green, yellow, red)
 Filing Timeliness (On-time %)
 Payment Timeliness (Payment success %)
 Supporting Documents Status (Completed %, Pending %, Rejected %)
 Deadline Adherence History (Month-by-month breakdown)

5. Chatbot / Chatbox Features
Chat History: All conversations should be stored and accessible by both client and firm staff.
Admin Dashboard Features:
 Assign conversations to specific team members.
 Internal notes visible only to firm staff.

Tax Types
These are the following core tax types:
 Pay as You Earn Tax (PAYE Tax)
 Withholding Tax (WHT)
 Personal Income Tax (PIT)
 Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
 Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 Excise Tax
 Payroll Tax

2. Currency
 All transactions, reports, and dashboards must display amounts in Sierra Leone
Leones (SLE).
 Reports and receipts should explicitly state the currency.

3. Document Management
The system must support secure upload, storage, version control, and retrieval of the
following document types with examples:
 Tax Year (2025 Tax Year)
 Tax Type (PAYE Tax, WHT)
 Tax Returns (The Betts Firm PAYE Tax Return for January 2025)
 Tax Receipts (The Betts Firm PAYE Tax Receipt for January 2025)
 Tax Calculations (The Betts Firm PAYE Tax Calculation for January 2025)
 ITAS Submission Form (The Betts Firm PAYE Tax ITAS Form for January 2025)
